# Reciptory.

[Reciptory](https://reciptory.firebaseapp.com/) is a native mobile app and PWA.
Instagram for recipes + inventory management.
Front-end developed with Ionic Framework on top of Angular.
Back-end developed with NestJS Framework and MongoDB.

## Try it locally.

- Clone both the front-end and back-end repositories.
- Run `npm i` in both repositories.
- Launch the back-end via `npm run start:dev`.
- Launch the front-end via `npm start`.

## Considerations.

- Deployed version doesn't support image uploading, since the back-end is deployed in Heroku.
- Scanner only works in the native mobile version.
